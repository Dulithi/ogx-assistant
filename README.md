- Embeds text data from AIESECâ€™s web pages and PDF documents.

### 2. **Fetching Relevant Context**

- User queries are converted into embeddings.
- The database is queried to find the most relevant context.
- If no relevant context is found, the assistant relies on OpenAIâ€™s general knowledge.

### 3. **Generating Responses**

- The AI constructs structured and informative responses using Markdown formatting.
- The chatbot ensures accuracy and avoids hallucinations by prioritizing database information.
